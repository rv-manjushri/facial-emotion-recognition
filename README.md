# facial-emotion-recognition
The objective of this project is to detect and classify facial expressions from facial images using a deep learning approach. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to classify the input images into one of seven emotion categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. 

### Emotions Detected
- Angry 😡
- Disgust 🤢
- Fear 😨
- Happy 😊
- Neutral 😐
- Sad 😢
- Surprise 😲

### Project Highlights
- Dataset: FER-2013 style facial expression dataset (grayscale 48×48 images)  
- Model: Custom CNN with 4 convolutional blocks, dropout for regularization  
- Training Accuracy: **~71.5%**  
- Validation Accuracy: **~63.2%**  
- Trained for 100 epochs with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss
